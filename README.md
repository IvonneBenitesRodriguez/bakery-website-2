# Project : bakery-website-2 
This is the 2nd version of the Bakery Site named _lebongu bakery and chocolatier artisan_.

## My motivation
My main motivation to build this site was to help my friend to have a presence in internet. She is a pastry chef and needed a site to show her products and commercialise it.
I definitely enjoyed the development process, the learning and putting in practice of Bootstrap and the interaction with the needs of the customer.

## Good things about this project
The project stands out because of the great variety of products we can show to the potential customers. The site provides the functionality to show each product's page.

## Features of the project
* The project has a very complete home page.
* A navigation bar with the logo of the company.
* A small gallery with the main products. Each picture has a functionality of zoom-in effect when customer hovers it.
* For **marketing effects** we used a *parallax scrolling effect* with the main relevant words which identifies **lebongu bakery and chocolatier artisan**
* In the *parallax scrolling effect part* there is button that when user gives click pops-up a window with a small introduction of the company.
* A main gallery with all the products classified by its categories with a pop-ups window to see in detail each product. 
* The pop-ups window has a button that gives you the functionality to transport the user to another page that describes in deep each product. 
* It also contains a footer with information and contacts links in social networks like instagram and facebook. Each of them with its logo.
