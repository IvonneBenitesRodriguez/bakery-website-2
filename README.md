# Project : bakery-website-2 
#### This is the 2nd version of the Bakery Site named _lebongu bakery and chocolatier artisan_.

## My motivation
#### My main motivation to build this site was to help my friend to have a presence in internet. She is a pastry chef and needed a site to show her products and commercialise it.
#### I definitely enjoyed the development process, the learning and putting in practice of Bootstrap and the interaction with the needs of the customer.

## Good things about this project
#### The project stands out because of the great variety of products we can show to the potential customers.
